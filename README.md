to use this user interface and model, all that needs to be done is change the location of the SAV file for the rf_model in the user interface python code from what it is in the code (where string 'filename' has been declared), to the directory that it is in wherever is is being used. Other than that, the code should run as expected by simply using whatever IDE to run python code, we were using VS Code and just clicked the run button.

Other than that, the Jupyter Files that were used to make the code have been included as well. Furthermore, other inclusions are other SAV files for models that were saved but were not used in the UI

Dependency wise, the user should have scikit-learn and numpy installed.
